Ideas:
    Antony/Cooper:
        Block that becomes floor
        Block that becomes immovable wall
        Plate that opens doors or makes paths
    Grady:
        A "light" block that works like other blocks except that it can't hold down the goal plate
        Different colors of blocks that are able to activate differently colored plates
